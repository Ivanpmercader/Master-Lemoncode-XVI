# Theming - Vite + TypeScript + Sass Project with Theming

This project is built using Vite with TypeScript and Sass to create a dynamic theming system. It defines two distinct themes by utilizing Sass variables, allowing for easy switching between the themes. These variables control aspects such as colors, fonts, and other style properties.

The themes are applied globally through the main stylesheet, where the corresponding variables are imported based on the selected theme. This approach allows for a flexible and maintainable theming system in the application, making it simple to switch or customize themes as needed.
