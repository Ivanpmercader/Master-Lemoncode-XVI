# Applications Laboratory: REST API & GraphQL

This repository contains two applications designed to practice API calls using both REST API and GraphQL standards. The goal is to apply best practices for API consumption while working with the public Rick and Morty API.

## Repository Overview

The repository includes:

1. **REST API Application:**
   - Implements API requests following RESTful principles.
   - Uses JavaScript's `fetch` to interact with the Rick and Morty API.
   - Includes multiple exercises to practice API consumption and organization.
   - Includes multiple configs in vite

2. **GraphQL Application:**
   - Fetches and displays data using GraphQL queries.
   - Allows users to browse a list of characters, select one to view its details, and filter characters by name.
   - Supports pagination and utilizes Material-UI for UI components.

## Features

- Two separate applications for learning both REST API and GraphQL.
- Exercises that guide users through making API requests, handling responses, and displaying data.
- Use of the public Rick and Morty API as the data source.
- Pagination and filtering functionality for better user experience in Graphql application

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, JavaScript
- **REST API:** Fetch API for data requests
- **GraphQL:** Fetch API for querying data
- **UI Components:** Material-UI (MUI)
