        <p>We try your eye, but can you change everything? doing some work for us "pro bono" will really add to your portfolio i promise, 
            and that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please labrador this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, 
            and make the curtains blue. Can you make it faster? what is a hamburger menu could you rotate the picture to show the other side 
            of the room? I really think this could go viral.</p>
